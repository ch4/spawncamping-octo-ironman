### Changelog for 0.1.94 ###

* Simplified Array.prototype.shift and also fixed a bug that caused deleted 
  indexes to take precendence over existing ones
* Implemented Array.prototype.sort
* Split functionality from Object into Object, ValueObject and ArrayObject to
  decrease the memory overhead of normal (non array/value) objects by 40 bytes. 
* Fixed a bug where delegates with "Box array" and "Object array" as last
  parameter would fail if no arguments were supplied
* Fixed a bug where the calls to DynamicScope.get and DynamicScope.set had
  gotten their arguments switched causing any usage of the with statement
  to crash the runtime
* Cleaned up Compiler.Core.compile
* Fixed a bug in Array.prototype.pop where it would crash if .length was 0 
* Fixed a bug in Array.prototype.pop and .shift where it would return undefined 
  even if the index existed in the prototype
* Most Array.prototype functions should no work on normal objects (e.g: if you
  transfer .pop to Object.prototype it will work correctly with normal objects)
* Added support for sparse arrays in Array.prototype.sort
* Big cleanup of IronJS.Utils and IronJS.Expr modules
* Implemented decodeURI, decodeURIComponent, encodeURI, encodeURIComponent
